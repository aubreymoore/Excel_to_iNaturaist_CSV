# Extracting Data from Excel Spreadsheets into a CSV for Upload to iNaturalist

Dr. Joel Miles, Palau Invasive Species Coordinator, has been storing data from a Palau Invasive Plant survey as spreadsheets in an Excel Workbook. As a technical challenge, I used Python in  a Jupyter  notebook] to wrangle the data into a CSV for ingestion by iNaturalist. [Click on this link to see my notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aubreymoore/Excel_to_iNaturaist_CSV/blob/master/Excel%20to%20iNat%20CSV.ipynb).

#### Notes:

 * that the Excel input file and the CSV output files are excluded from this repo because the data do not belong to me. 
* For some reason, the Jupyter notebook renderer in GitHub does not show images. That's why I am linking out to **nbviewer**.
