# Extracting Data from Excel Spreadsheets into a CSV for Upload to iNaturalist

Dr. Joel Miles, Palau Invasive Species Coordinator, has been storing data from a Palau Invasive Plant survey as spreadsheets in an Excel Workbook. As a technical challenge, I used Python in  a Jupyter  notebook] to wrangle the data into a CSV for ingestion by iNaturalist. [Click on this link to see my notebook](Excel to iNat CSV.ipynb).

#### Note:

* The Excel input file and the CSV output files are excluded from this repo because the data do not belong to me.
